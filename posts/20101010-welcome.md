# Welcome!

New [public-static](http://publicstatic.org) website was created. And this is a first blog post to demonstrate how everything works.

Directory structure:

* `assets` — static web site assets including stylesheets, javascript and assets images.
* `pages` — markdown-formatted web pages.
* `posts`
* `prototypes` — content prototypes for various page types. E.g. `default-post.md` file is a prototype for new blog posts. It will be cloned while creating each new post.
* `templates` — web page templates.
